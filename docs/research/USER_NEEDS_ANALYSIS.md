# User Needs Analysis

## Core User Need

**"I want to see EVERYTHING Claude Code CLI does!"**

The user's primary frustration: The current Claude Code UI hides the rich, meaningful information that the CLI displays in the terminal.

## Specific Requirements

### 1. Complete Transparency
- Show ALL information that Claude CLI outputs
- Not just spinners, but the **meaningful stuff**:
  - Which files are being read and why
  - What Claude is searching for
  - Progress through multi-step operations
  - Detailed error contexts
  - Resource usage and costs

### 2. Real-Time Visibility
- See operations as they happen
- Understand Claude's thought process
- Track progress through complex tasks
- Know when something goes wrong immediately

### 3. Educational Value
- Learn from Claude's approach
- Understand AI decision-making
- See patterns in how problems are solved
- Build intuition about AI-assisted coding

## What "Meaningful Stuff" Means

### NOT This:
- Generic spinners (⠋ ⠙ ⠹ ⠸)
- "Loading..." messages
- Basic progress bars

### YES This:
- "Reading /src/auth/login.jsx to understand authentication flow"
- "Found 23 references to deprecated API across 8 files"
- "Phase 2/4: Analyzing dependencies before refactoring"
- "Command failed: npm test (3 tests failing) - see details"
- "Using 15,247 tokens (~$0.23) - 75% through context window"

## User Journey

### Current Experience
1. Types request in chat
2. Sees "Using Read tool"
3. Waits...
4. Gets result
5. Wonders what happened in between

### Desired Experience
1. Types request in chat
2. Sees Claude break down the task into phases
3. Watches each file being analyzed with purpose
4. Understands why certain decisions are made
5. Learns from the process
6. Can intervene if needed

## Technical Requirements

### Must Have
- Capture full CLI output including ANSI codes
- Parse and display file paths, commands, patterns
- Show real-time progress updates
- Display token usage and costs
- Provide detailed error contexts

### Nice to Have
- Record and replay sessions
- Export detailed logs
- Search through execution history
- Set alerts for specific patterns
- Collaborative viewing

## Success Criteria

The enhanced UI is successful when:
1. Users can see EXACTLY what files Claude is working with
2. Users understand WHY Claude makes certain decisions  
3. Users can track resource usage in real-time
4. Users learn from watching Claude work
5. Debugging is easier with full context
6. No information is hidden or abstracted away

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1**: Dual-stream capture (JSON + Terminal)
2. **Phase 2**: Tool execution monitor with full context
3. **Phase 3**: Resource tracking and metrics
4. **Phase 4**: Process breakdown visualization
5. **Phase 5**: Enhanced error handling
6. **Phase 6**: Advanced features (replay, export, etc.)

## Key Insight

The user doesn't want a "simplified" interface - they want a **transparent** interface that shows the full power and complexity of what Claude is doing, presented in an understandable way.
